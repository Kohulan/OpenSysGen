# OpenSysGen : A tool for systematic conformer generation

This project describes a tool for systematic conformer generation of small molecules without the use of an energy cut-off , which is a user friendly tool, can simply be used by anyone who needs conformers to be generated to their projects. The tool is written in JAVA which incorporates Open Babel 2.4.1 JAVA binding libraries. Rotatable bonds are identified and systematically rotated with a pre-set increment. The pre-set increments for each class of rotatable bonds (from 0 to 10) was derived based on a dataset of 110 approved drugs. The tool was tested on a dataset of 428 drugs and results reveal that in all cases, conformers within 1 Ã… RMSD of the bioactive conformer were retrieved. 

Summary of dependencies:
-------------------------------
OpenSysGen is a tool built using JAVA so to run the tool Java Runtime Environment is thus required.

Also it uses Open Babel JAVA libraries and openbabel.jar is incuded in the OpenSysGen.jar file. To run the tool make sure OpenBabel 2.4.1 is installed on your system and the path is correctly set.

Usage
-----

To use OpenSysGen on any OS platform, make sure that Java Runtime Environment(JRE) and OpenBabel 2.4.1 are installed and the system PATH is set.
Download OpenSysGen.jar, in a single folder add the downloaded jar file and your small molecule files(pdb,sdf,mol and mol2).

Open the command window,
```bash
C:\OpenSysGen>java -jar OpenSysGen.jar filename.sdf
example: C:\OpenSysGen>java -jar OpenSysGen.jar Acetaminophen.sdf
multiple files (files with same extension): C:\OpenSysGen>java -jar OpenSysGen.jar Acetaminophen.sdf Salbutamol.sdf 
```
On terminal,
```bash
$ java -jar OpenSysGen.jar filename.sdf
example:$ java -jar OpenSysGen.jar Acetaminophen.sdf
multiple files (files with same extension):$ java -jar OpenSysGen.jar Acetaminophen.sdf Salbutamol.sdf 
```
